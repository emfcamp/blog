title: "Goodbye from Electromagnetic Field 2024"
---


Hello,

<br>This was the best EMF so far. We hope you enjoyed it as much as we did.

It would not have been possible without all the wonderful volunteers, speakers, installation-builders, performers, sponsors - and all of you!

Many thanks from the EMF team for making the festival feel like such a special place to be.

<br>There's a few things to wrap up before we hibernate for a year:

* � [Let us know](https://cloud.orga.emfcamp.org/apps/forms/s/gykaxpDTWXbRc6t8LMNBc382) if you became ill at EMF (or just after) 
* � You **have until December to [claim Lost Property](mailto:contact@emfcamp.org?subject=Lost&nbsp;property)**
* � Send us your [memories](https://wiki.emfcamp.org/2024/wiki/Memories) & [photos](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdqvJG9loGOWH9uEQEGvq5PfDZE0YYt4xsu8hjgpAhMKvZ0PQ/viewform)
* � Please give us [feedback](https://cloud.orga.emfcamp.org/apps/forms/s/wr2iRdTAPi4j6fSt9CGNN2iq)!
* � **Talk videos will be published in the coming months**
* � Help us collect [diversity statistics](https://www.emfcamp.org/account/details)
* � [Update](https://tildagon.badge.emfcamp.org/using-the-badge/flash-the-badge/) your Tildagon badge

## Infection Survey

If you became ill at EMF or shortly after (with COVID or anything else) please let us know by filling in our [infection survey](https://cloud.orga.emfcamp.org/apps/forms/s/gykaxpDTWXbRc6t8LMNBc382).

This allows us to keep track of any illnesses contracted during the festival and informs our health policy at future events.

## Lost property

If you think you lost something at EMF please [contact us now](mailto:contact@emfcamp.org?subject=Lost&nbsp;property) - we had 114 items handed in, so there's a good chance we have your beloved thing.

Any unclaimed items will be donated to charity at the end of the year.

## Memories & photos

It's impossible to see everything at EMF, so please share your [photographs and videos](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdqvJG9loGOWH9uEQEGvq5PfDZE0YYt4xsu8hjgpAhMKvZ0PQ/viewform) with us, as well as [blog posts, articles, and anything else](https://wiki.emfcamp.org/2024/wiki/Memories) that documents your time in the field.

If you post anything on social media please tag it with #emf2024 and @ us on [mastodon](https://social.emfcamp.org/@emf) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/emfcamp) so we don't miss it!

## Feedback

We love your feedback, both good and bad! [Let us know](https://cloud.orga.emfcamp.org/apps/forms/s/wr2iRdTAPi4j6fSt9CGNN2iq) what you loved and what you'd like to see improved in the future.

You don't have to have a potential solution but please keep feedback constructive. We can't guarantee it'll be fixed, but we will listen and take your feedback into account where possible.

## Diversity

We really care about making EMF an inclusive and welcoming event, and we want to continue to expand our community. To this end, just before the festival we published [our first diversity blog](https://blog.emfcamp.org/2024/05/30/diversity-at-emf-2024/) which includes statistics on speaker diversity at EMF 2024 and our plans for the future.

We'll be publishing these statistics for every future event to track our progress, and we will be publishing statistics for our previous events if the data is available.

Please make sure you've completed our [2024 diversity form](https://www.emfcamp.org/account/details) - give it a quick look even if you've already filled it in as we've added some new questions.

## Talk videos

We will be publishing recordings of every recorded talk over the next few weeks on [media.ccc.de](https://media.ccc.de/c/emf2024) and [our youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ElectromagneticField).

Please be patient - it takes a lot of work to edit so many great talks! If you spoke and allowed us to record it, we will let you know when your talk has been published.

## Tildagon & Hexpansions

We've seen a lot of people having fun with their [Tildagon badges](https://tildagon.badge.emfcamp.org/) and are absolutely delighted by the number of people creating [Hexpansions](https://tildagon.badge.emfcamp.org/hexpansions/creating-hexpansions/) to plug into it - we are aware of over 60!

The badge team have been busy working on [the documentation](https://tildagon.badge.emfcamp.org/) and have substantially improved the software with features & fixes being added every week, so please make sure you [update the firmware](https://tildagon.badge.emfcamp.org/using-the-badge/flash-the-badge/) on your badge. We'll be working on it continuously over the next two years.

If you're inspired to make your own Hexpansion, [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/) have kindly provided us with $50 vouchers for their prototyping service. To claim one, [send us a short description](mailto:contact@emfcamp.org?subject=PCBWay) of your Hexpansion idea.

## Fabric

If you loved the EMF 2024 theme, why not make a pair of pyjamas or a fashionable jacket covered in it? The designer is organising a bulk order of fabrics printed with the tiling "network" design you saw all over the festival.

**Orders for fabric must be placed by the end of Tuesday 25th June 2024** in [Morag's shop](https://moraghickman.myshopify.com/).

## Reuse your SIM card

If you bought a SIM card from the shop to use with our on-site phone network please don't throw it away - you can use it again at other events, or reprogram it at home!

Email the ICCID (the number on the front) to [poc@emfcamp.org](mailto:poc@emfcamp.org?subject=SIM&nbsp;unlock) and we will send you the key to reprogram your SIM.

## EMF 2026

EMF will return in 2026. **You must be [subscribed to our mailing list](https://www.emfcamp.org/about/contact) to be notified when it is announced.**

If you spoke, volunteered, installed, or in some way contributed to EMF 2024 you are **guaranteed tickets for EMF 2026** when they go on sale. If you're worried that we might not have a record of you volunteering please [let us know](mailto:contact@emfcamp.org?subject=Volunteering&nbsp;ticket).

**EMF is run entirely by volunteers and we need your help** to make it happen. We'll be having a rest for the next few months and serious planning for 2026 will start next year.

However this year went so well that the team are excited, energised, and scheming is already occurring - **if you'd like to get involved and make EMF even better please [get in touch](mailto:contact@emfcamp.org?subject=2026&nbsp;Volunteering)** or sign up to our [volunteer mailing list](https://www.emfcamp.org/about/volunteering). We'd love to have you on the team.
