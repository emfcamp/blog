title: "EMF 2024 Final Ticket Sale"
---
This is a quick reminder that the third and **final** batch of tickets for EMF 2024 will be going [on sale](https://www.emfcamp.org/tickets) this Tuesday (20th February) at 21:00 GMT (UTC+0).

**The previous two batches have sold out quickly, and this is the last major sale of tickets.**

But if you do miss this batch don't panic - there will be smaller batches of returned tickets sold closer to the event.

Don't forget that if you submit an accepted talk, workshop, or performance to our [Call For Participation](https://www.emfcamp.org/cfp) you are guaranteed tickets to the event!

Love,
The EMF Team
