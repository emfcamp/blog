Villages
--------
As usual at EMF, our camp is organised into villages, and everyone is encouraged to join, or create a village of your
own.  If you need an introduction to what we mean by that, see our [village guide](https://emfcamp.org/about/villages).

To make things easier for villages, we offer villages the opportunity to book a marquee and furniture through us, which 
will be set up and ready for when you arrive on site. The list of what is available, pricing and booking can be found 
on the [web shop](https://emfcamp.org/tickets/hire).

Volunteers
----------
EMF is entirely organised & run by unpaid volunteers. There are two routes to get involved: either join the organisation
team as a pre-event volunteer or contribute a few hours of your time helping out during the event as an on-site volunteer.

Right now the following teams are looking for pre-event volunteers:

* [Art & Installations](https://emfcamp.org/about/volunteer-roles#arts) - Bringing artists and art to EMF
* [Content](https://emfcamp.org/about/volunteer-roles#content) - Organising, outreach and support for: talks, workshops & music
* [Cybar](https://emfcamp.org/about/volunteer-roles#cybar) - The second bar, music venue, and arts space
* [Design](https://emfcamp.org/about/volunteer-roles#design) - Visuals and physical assets across the festival
* [Logistics](https://emfcamp.org/about/volunteer-roles#logistics) - Ensuring things get where they need to be at the
  right time
* [Tent Team](https://emfcamp.org/about/volunteer-roles#tent) - Helping people new to the event get set up
* [Volunteer](https://emfcamp.org/about/volunteer-roles#volunteer) - Managing volunteers, shift sign-up, scheduling,
  and rewards

You can see a full list of the pre-event volunteer roles, and details of each team on our [website](https://emfcamp.org/about/volunteer-roles).
To express interest, please send an email to [volunteers@emfcamp.org](mailto:volunteers@emfcamp.org) introducing
yourself, specifying the role you’re interested in and any experience you might have.

If you can't find a role that interests you but would still like to help pre-event, get in touch - we'll do our best to
find something that interests you! If you’d rather help during the event you’ll be able to sign up for shifts via the
website closer to the time.
