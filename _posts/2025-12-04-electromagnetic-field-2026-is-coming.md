Hello!

Electromagnetic Field 2026 will be held on **Friday 17th to Sunday 19th July 2026**, and we'll be back at **Eastnor Castle Deer Park** in Herefordshire. As always, you're welcome to arrive from Thursday morning to get your villages set up and stay until midday on Monday 20th July to get the most out of the event.

We'll be sending another email once we've set the ticket sale dates.

## Theme

In 2026, EMF goes to **space**!

Not just outer space, though - we want to celebrate discovery, engineering, exploration, and fascination with our home planet, too. From distant galaxies to our pale blue dot, neutron stars to the smallest microbacteria, we want you to share and get excited about what fascinates you *out there*.

All contributions to the event are loved and welcomed, but if you want to be inspired by the event theme [our full announcement can be found here](https://blog.emfcamp.org/2025/11/28/theme-announcement/).

## Suggestions welcome!

Our team is on the lookout for new and varied speakers, teachers, performers, builders, and enthusiasts: If you’ve seen anyone recently, or know of an interesting person who might fit with the EMF vibe, [let us know](https://grist.orga.emfcamp.org/forms/1JR2ywPdBbF7AmQFwwH7hm/6) and we'll reach out to them.

We'll be opening our public Call for Participation in the new year, but before then we'd love your help to bring new ideas and communities to EMF and make it even more interesting!

## Until then

To tide you over until next year, all the video recordings from EMF 2024 are now available on [media.ccc.de](https://media.ccc.de/c/emf2024) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1Hr6VkuONaHvvLPgjFn3uUEl4xH6xUhQ), along with talks from every EMF since 2012.

See you again soon!

Love,\
The EMF Team
