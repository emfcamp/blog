## In 2026, EMF goes to space!

Not just outer space, though – we want to celebrate discovery, engineering, exploration, and fascination with our home planet, too. From distant galaxies to our pale blue dot, neutron stars to the smallest microbacteria, we want you to get excited about what fascinates you out there.

In the coming months we’ll be publishing further inspiration, graphics, concepts, and posters for you to share and reuse in your own projects.

We’re looking for volunteers to help us ahead of the event to design and assemble site decoration, and contribute plants to our orbital greenhouse. If you know your way around a sewing machine or potting shed, or want to help the Design team in other ways, [sign up here](https://grist.orga.emfcamp.org/4DBH2QnXLavW/Design/p/16)!

We love to see your contributions about whatever gets you nerdy and excited – we hope you’ll be inspired to join in.

It’s a very big universe out there. Gazing up at the night sky it can be hard to tell a satellite from a star from a galaxy, but further study is rewarded with a deeper understanding.

Find something that fascinates you, from the whorls on your fingertips to the spiral arms of a galaxy. Take that second look, and a third, and a fourth. Show us what you see, and help others explore.

We may be standing on a pale blue dot, but there’s definitely a lot going on down here.
