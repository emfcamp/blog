---

We're excited to announce that Electromagnetic Field will return to [Eastnor Castle Deer Park](https://eastnorcastle.com/eastnor-deer-park/) from May 30th - June 2nd this year.

Tickets will be released at the following times during February:

* Saturday 3rd February at 14:00 GMT (UTC+0)
* Sunday 11th February at 11:00 GMT
* Tuesday 20th February at 21:00 GMT

As always, tickets are only available at [emfcamp.org/tickets](https://www.emfcamp.org/tickets). You can see the full list of ticket options and prices [now](https://www.emfcamp.org/tickets).

**We expect each batch of tickets to sell out very quickly, so please set a reminder.**

If you're looking for alternative ways to get a ticket, keep an eye out for our Call for Participation which will go live in the coming weeks - all accepted talks and workshops are guaranteed the ability to buy tickets.

If you gave a talk, workshop, or volunteered at EMF in 2022 you will receive a guaranteed ticket voucher via email. If you do not receive a voucher by Monday 12th February, please [let us know](mailto:contact@emfcamp.org).

## Make it happen

EMF is entirely organised and run by attendees. We need your help to make this year's EMF the best yet, so please take a look at the [teams looking for volunteers](https://www.emfcamp.org/about/volunteer-roles).

## We need sponsors

While your tickets pay for the basic event infrastructure, we need sponsors to help make EMF accessible, beautiful, and full of fascinating things.

If you are interested in sponsoring EMF all the details are on [our sponsorship page](https://www.emfcamp.org/sponsor).

## Relive EMF 2022

All the talk videos from EMF 2022 are now available to stream and download. If you want to catch up on things you missed and get excited about what's to come this year, you can find them all through the [EMF 2022 lineup](https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2022) or [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1Hr6VkuONaECQTb0-TxGPVrQomXTWhbm).

If a video is missing, either the speaker requested it wasn't recorded, or it was one of the 15% of recordings which were unfortunately lost due to technical issues.

## Keep up to date
