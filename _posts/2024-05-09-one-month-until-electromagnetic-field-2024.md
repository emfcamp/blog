Hello!

We're almost there. In less than a month we'll be seeing you in the field.

# Important things

* **If you bought tickets for other people please [transfer them](https://www.emfcamp.org/account/tickets)** - otherwise they won't receive event information, or be able to register for workshops.
* There are a very **limited number of [tickets on sale](https://www.emfcamp.org/tickets)**!
* We've **announced most of the [talks and workshops](https://emfcamp.org/line-up)**!
* You will need to register for workshops in advance this year.
* We still urgently [need sponsors](https://www.emfcamp.org/sponsor).

# The Line-up

We had an incredible response to our Call for Participation, with far more talks and workshops submitted than ever before!

You can now **view the announced [talks and workshops](https://www.emfcamp.org/schedule/2024)**, and favourite things to build a personalised programme. This also helps our scheduling robot place popular talks on larger stages.

This isn't the final line-up - there are still talks, workshops, performances, and installations to come, but hopefully these should whet your appetite. We will be announcing the schedule timings closer to the event.

# Workshop signup

Due to workshops being extremely oversubscribed, this year the majority of workshop places will be assigned by lottery. We will be asking you to rank your favourite workshops and will try to ensure as many people as possible get a slot in one of their preferences.

Each person will only be able to "win" a single workshop slot, but there will also be some places available on a first-come first-served basis during the festival.

**Workshop registration will require signing into the website, so if you have bought tickets for other people please [transfer them](https://www.emfcamp.org/account/tickets) over**. You will not be able to sign up for workshops on behalf of other people.

More details of how to sign up for workshops will follow in the next email, and we plan to open workshop registration after the 20th May.

# Workshop assistants

We need assistants for some workshops including Hebocon (low-tech robot assembly), and wallet-making (leatherwork and sewing). Please [contact us](mailto:content@emfcamp.org?subject=Workshop%20Helper) if you would like to help.

A few workshops are also looking for assistants with specific skills:

* Pico-8 Games workshop: 1-2 volunteers with experience of coding in Pico-8 (Lua), for a 2h workshop. [Volunteer to help](mailto:content@emfcamp.org?subject=Pico-8%20Workshop%20Helper)!
* "Applied String Theory" workshop: 2-3 volunteers with experience of Macrame (small knots) or a willingness to learn in advance, for a 2h workshop. [Volunteer to help](mailto:content@emfcamp.org?subject=Macrame%20Workshop%20Helper)!
* Magic workshop: One volunteer familiar with close-up magic (with playing cards, and using a thumb-tip), for a 2h workshop. [Volunteer to help](mailto:content@emfcamp.org?subject=Magic%20Workshop%20Helper)!

# Volunteering

EMF entirely runs on volunteers and **we need you** to help make it happen.

**Every volunteer gets a guaranteed ticket to the next festival**. From serving drinks at the bar, to installing our power network, to cooking for other volunteers - everyone gets to come back in 2026. If that isn't enough, you also get a hot meal from our excellent volunteer kitchen!

**You can now [sign up to volunteer](https://www.emfcamp.org/volunteer)**. The website has a full list of the roles and shifts that need covering during the festival.

We also need volunteers to help before and after the event with build-up and tear-down, particularly afterwards on Monday 3rd & Tuesday 4th June. **If you are able to come early or leave late and help out, email [volunteer@emfcamp.org](mailto:volunteer@emfcamp.org)**. This will involve strenuous work.

Please do not turn up to the festival site early without contacting us first!

# Installations

Many of you bring weird and wonderful creations to EMF for other attendees to admire and interact with. To make this easier for us to handle (and to ensure your giant robot has power) please make sure you [register your installations](https://www.emfcamp.org/cfp/installation) with our Call for Participation.

# Food vendors

This year delicious food will be served up by:

* Goodness Gracious Healthy Foods -- Fresh, healthy vegan and vegetarian food, with plenty of falafel, halloumi and hummus.
* Cantina el Burrito -- Tasty Mexican burritos, nachos and chilli. 
* Isabelâ€™s Bakery -- Sweet and savoury crepes, and fresh baked goods.
* La Pizzeria -- Freshly made pizza and healthy toppings, available with gluten free bases. 
* The Grazing Shed -- Quality burgers and fries from this Welsh burger joint.
* Colombo Street -- Award Winning Sri Lankan street food.
* The Coffee Vagabond -- Amazing coffee, courtesy of our favourite returning caffeine maestros.

All food vendors will be open 11am-8pm Thursday through Sunday. Vendors may also open based on demand outside these hours.

# Sponsors

While your ticket covers most of the infrastructure that makes the festival possible, many things such as our free childcare and live transcription are entirely funded by wonderful sponsors.

It has been extremely difficult to raise sponsorship this year and **we are still urgently looking for sponsors to help make EMF happen** - if we do not secure more funding we will be forced to cancel some of our plans.

Anyone interested in sponsoring can find out more on our [ sponsorship website](https://www.emfcamp.org/sponsor). 

We would like to sincerely thank the following sponsors for helping this year:

 * MathWorks
 * UTAW
 * AND Digital
 * Mythic Beasts
 * Espressif
 * Texas Instruments
 * Bosch Sensortec
 * Onega
 * Codethink
 * PCBWay

<br>See you in the field!

Love,
The EMF Team
